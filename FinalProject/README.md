# This is my CS50x final project: TO DO Web App

#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/fCgOFAfTxf4>

#### Description:

I wrote `TO DO Web App` using Python, Flask and SQL built in part on the web track's distribution code.
The application is called CS50 TODO, and it allows the user to create a personal to-do list.
In this program you can register, log in, log out, edit and write new to do's.
Only the person who registers with a username and password will have access to the list.
All usernames and passwords are saved in database named finance. Login and logout will be available to the user.
The user will be able to review his personal list and add new items to it.
Also in my project I leaved my linked in link. Thank you for your attantion, I hope that you liked my project.
